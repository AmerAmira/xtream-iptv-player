**DISCLAIMER: THIS APP DOESN'T CONTAIN STREAMS, NEITHER PROVIDES ACCESS TO STREAMS**

You can watch IPTV streams from Xtream-Codes IPTV panel.

Features:

- No need for "IPTV Core" library from XTREAM-CODES to work
- Current EPG on live playlist
- NO ADS

Uses parts of exoplayer and IJKPlayer.

WARNING: If you have shitty protection, this app will probably ban your IP/account as it uses scripts from the Panel itself.
